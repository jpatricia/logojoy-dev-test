# logojoy-dev-test

This is a React app that is based on `create-react-app`.
To run the app:  `npm start`.
This app include SASS, so if there are any changes on `*.scss` and `*.js`, it will reload the app automatically.

Cases that are included in the dialog box image thumbnails on the left:
1. If hover on the image thumbnail, it will open the image on the right column, and it will go back to logo image by default as mouse is out of the image thumbnail.
2. If image thumbnail is clicked, it will open the image on the right column and it will stay there until the thumbnail is unclicked. So, hovering on the other image, will open the bigger image on the right column, but it will ignore onMouseOut until image thumbnail is unclicked.
